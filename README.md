# GameGuyScriptHub

__! IMPORTANT !__

 V4 and V3 will be developed in parallel, but if I want to script V5 (which I will probably do), V4 will probably be deprecated since I don't really like it and V3 will get most (except keybinds) new features in V4 and V3 will get renamed to GGSH Classic (name WIP)

My script hub! Started as an easy way for my friend to access Pet Simulator X scripts, grown into a full-fledged script hub!

### GGSH V4 Script: `loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://rentry.org/ggsh-main/raw"))()`
### GGSH V3 (Classic) Script: `loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://rentry.org/ggsh-old/raw"))()`
### GGSH V2 Script: `loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://rentry.org/ggsh-v2/raw"))()`
